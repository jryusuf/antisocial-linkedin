To run this docker dev container in your local or remote machine you need to install Docker and vscode to start

It comes with requirements.txt file and automatically install all modules during setup, no need to virtual environment

## Creating your project
After running up the dev container, you need to rename your project and change the remote of your origin for git

Create master for deployment and release branches for builds, or you can rename them however you see fit. If you change the branch names do not forget to change the github action on tags with the new ones in the .github/workflows folder. Don't forget to create branch protection rules for these branches with the listed options:

Require a pull request before merging
Require review from Code Owners
Require status checks to pass before merging
Require bracnhes to be up to date before merging
Status checks that are required: Select [Deployment-Test] or [Release-Test-And-Artifact]

on:
    pull_request:
        branches:
        - master or release(<-----update here)

This project containes a docker image file and when you create a pull request to relase branch it will create the docker image and publish it to your docker image hub

Update the tags at the end of the release-test-and-image-creating.yaml file with your own docker repo information

For authentication of your docker repo you need to create 2 repository secrets in your repo settings:
DOCKER_PASSWORD
DOCKER_USERNAME

For deployment you can update the master-test-and-deployment.yaml file for custom deployment strategy with some other github actions
